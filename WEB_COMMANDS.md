# Web Automation Commands

JARVIS can now control your browser and YouTube! Here's what you can do:

## 🎵 YouTube Commands

### Play Music/Videos
- "Play lofi music on YouTube"
- "Play Bohemian Rhapsody on YouTube"
- "Search for cooking tutorials on YouTube"
- "Open YouTube and play jazz"

**What happens:**
- JARVIS opens YouTube with your search
- You select which video to play (auto-play isn't possible without admin)

## 🌐 Browser Tab Control

### Safari & Chrome Support
- "Open a new tab"
- "Close this tab"
- "Go back"
- "Go forward"  
- "Refresh the page"

**Note:** Browser must be open first!

## 🔗 Direct URLs

- "Open YouTube.com"
- "Open Gmail"
- "Go to GitHub.com"
- "Open Netflix"

## 📋 Example Session

```
YOU: "Open Safari"
JARVIS: "Opening Safari for you, sir."

YOU: "Open a new tab"
JARVIS: "Opening a new tab in Safari, sir."

YOU: "Play relaxing music on YouTube"
JARVIS: "Certainly, sir. Opening YouTube with relaxing music. You can select which video to play."

[YouTube opens with search results]
[You click the video you want]

YOU: "Open another new tab"
JARVIS: "Opening a new tab in Safari, sir."
```

## 🎯 Pro Tips

1. **Say the full command clearly:**
   - ✅ "Play lofi hip hop on YouTube"
   - ❌ "YouTube music" (too vague)

2. **Browser must be open:**
   - First: "Open Safari"
   - Then: "Open a new tab"

3. **Be specific:**
   - "Play [exact song name] on YouTube"
   - Not just "play music"

4. **Works with both browsers:**
   - Safari (native Mac)
   - Chrome (if installed)

## ⚠️ Limitations

### What JARVIS CANNOT Do (No Admin Access)

❌ **Auto-play videos** - Browser security prevents this
❌ **Click buttons on websites** - Needs Selenium + admin
❌ **Fill forms automatically** - Needs browser automation
❌ **Extract website data** - Needs scraping tools
❌ **Download files automatically** - Security restrictions

### What JARVIS CAN Do ✅

✅ **Open YouTube searches** - You click what to play
✅ **Control browser tabs** - New, close, navigate
✅ **Open any website** - Direct URL access

## 📝 Cheat Sheet

|---------|--------------|
| "Play [song] on YouTube" | Opens YouTube search |
| "Open a new tab" | Creates new browser tab |

**Remember:** Web automation without admin is limited to opening URLs and controlling tabs. For full automation (clicking, form filling), you'd need admin access to install browser drivers.

But what JARVIS can do is still very useful for quick access and navigation! 🎯
